### PRE WORK:

Please complete this pre-work before class on Thursday, May 18th 2023.

- Ensure you have set-up your Colab Pro subscription, and verify you can start an A100 runtime.
- Run the [Fine-tune_BLOOMZ_Pre_Work](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GzHdbIarvnRee_Ix9bdhx1a1v0_G_eqo?usp=sharing) notebook on Colab.
- Come prepared with an idea and a strategy to build your own dataset (synthetic, or curated). While a sample project will be provided, it's always more fun to bring your own ideas!
