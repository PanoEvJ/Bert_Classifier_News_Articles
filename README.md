# <h1 align="center" id="heading">:wave: Welcome to the Building With Large Language Models Workshop!</h1>

## ‚òëÔ∏è Objectives
By the end of this course you will: 
- [ ] Learn the essentials of prompting and fine-tuning 
- [ ] Fine-tune the structure of open-source LLMs using a data-centric approach
- [ ] Create a ChatGPT-like interface for your own data using indexing and chaining
- [ ] Build and deploy three different Generative AI applications

## üèóÔ∏è Project-Based Learning
In this workshop, you will deploy three applications in three weeks, including your own unique LLM capstone project in Week 3. You‚Äôll leverage the most powerful LLMs to build and deploy personalized applications in your domain and for your use cases. You‚Äôll also fine-tune LLMs to improve classic ML algorithm performance, teach LLMs new structure, and build a question-answering tool for your documents. 

## üß™ Technical Requirements and Prerequisites
This workshop is intended for software engineers, data scientists, ML engineers, or others who have strong Python skills and have working experience deploying applications. Before the workshop, you should: 
- [ ] Create an account on Hugging Face and be familiar with Hugging Face Datasets, Models, and Spaces. We recommend checking out our [Zero to Deployment Adventure Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rmIxwbNLiUcb_4pDDdlCQ5RvfP4-LcnrHeEey_MQDAg/edit?usp=sharing) from our recent Building Generative AI Applications Workshop, and checking out the [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) for more information.
Create a [Google Colab Pro account](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is what we will be using for demos during the workshop.
